Loan defaults threaten financial stability, requiring accurate prediction beyond traditional methods.
Implement machine learning for precise loan default prediction, minimizing risks and optimizing resource allocation
Dataset: Loan Default Prediction
Dataset Size:  2,55,347 rows, 18 columns
Content: Contains borrower information and loan characteristics
Addressing the challenge of predicting loan defaulters.
Employing an ensemble of machine learning models for enhanced accuracy.
Models include Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
Each model contributes unique strengths to the predictive process.
Aim to create a robust and accurate system for identifying potential loan defaulters.
